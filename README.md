Featuring:

  - Twitch OAuth integration
  - Discord as CMS for user uploads
  - Extraction tools for existing subreddit content

## Base system design

Go backend with PostgreSQL and responsive PWA React frontend. The backend integrates with
Twitch via OAuth2, leverages Discord as a CMS, and internally authenticates with
access/refresh tokens with rotation. The API layer is mostly GraphQL
generated by ent, entgql and gqlgen, with the frontend consuming it via
generated client code.

Deployments are made automatically to fly.io upon successful testing. Supabase
migrations done on app startup.
